# Fract-ol Project 42


### This project is about creating fractals using a Graphics Library.
A Fractal is a type of mathematical shape that is infinitely complex. 
In essence, a Fractal is a pattern that repeats itself forever, and every part of the Fractal, regardless of how you zoom in, or zoom out, 
looks very similar to the whole image.
